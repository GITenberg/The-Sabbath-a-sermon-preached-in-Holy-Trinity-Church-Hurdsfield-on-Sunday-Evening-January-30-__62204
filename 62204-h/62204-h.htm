SABBATH.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">ISAIAH LVIII. 13,
14.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">If thou turn away thy foot from the
Sabbath</span>, <span class="smcap">from doing thy pleasure on my
holy day</span>; <span class="smcap">and call the Sabbath a
delight</span>, <span class="smcap">the holy of the Lord</span>,
<span class="smcap">honourable</span>; <span class="smcap">and

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no belief so universal as
that of a future state of existence.&nbsp; Men are born into the
world, appear for a brief space upon the stage of life, and then
sink into the grave.&nbsp; But the human mind has looked beyond
this to a distant and unknown Future.&nbsp; Those who were
destitute of a Divine Revelation had necessarily very vague and
imperfect notions respecting it.&nbsp; Hence the many different
theories, the belief in which has prevailed from time to time, in
the heathen world; and, in all of these, the certainty of rewards
and punishments, and of future happiness or misery, was
admitted.&nbsp; Their heaven, indeed, was peopled with strange
divinities, and the enjoyments which they anticipated <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>were generally
of an earthly and sensual nature; yet their belief in it seemed
naturally to suggest the necessity of some preparation by
themselves.&nbsp; The two things appeared to be
inseparable.&nbsp; The entrance to the heathen Elysium was to be
obtained only by piety towards the gods.&nbsp; Hence the gorgeous
temples which rose to their honour in the cities of ancient
Greece and Italy; the sacrifices daily made at their altars; the
prayers and costly offerings at their shrines.&nbsp; And not only
so, but particular portions of time seem from the earliest
periods to have been regarded as sacred, and set apart for holy
purposes; and it is remarkable, that the consecration of one day
in seven appears to have been almost universal in the heathen
world.&nbsp; This may, perhaps, be attributed to some faint rays
of that Divine Revelation, which was given to a part of the human
race, and which tradition had handed down: the principle itself
was universally acknowledged.&nbsp; That Revelation, indeed, has
cleared away the mystery which enshrouded the eternal world; it
has explained the nature of that happiness which is provided for
man; it has enjoined the observance of every seventh day as a
time of preparation for it; it has distinctly laid down the
obligation and duties of that day; and it has unfolded the
promises which <span class="smcap">God</span> has graciously made
to those who shall habitually honour it.</p>
<p>Now it is not to be wondered at, that a command embracing so
many different duties, and the <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>obligation of which is so universal,
should, in all ages, have been regarded in different lights by
different nations and individuals.&nbsp; Even in our own land,
many contradictory opinions are held respecting it, by those who
yet all unite in a profession of Christianity.</p>
<p>The subject, as you are aware, is now occupying a large share
of public attention, from the fact that an attempt is being made
to infringe the sanctity of the Sabbath, as it is now by the law
of this country protected, and in fact to legalize its
desecration.&nbsp; Hence it becomes the plain and manifest duty
of every Christian man to be well informed as to the obligation
which <span class="smcap">God</span> has laid upon him to observe
and keep holy this day, as also to know the especial purposes for
which it was set apart.&nbsp; And I have thought that it may not
be an unprofitable subject for our meditation this evening, if I
briefly lay before you the Scripture grounds for the observance
of the Sabbath; and then, as far as I may be able to do so,
endeavour to show you in what manner it should be kept holy.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; And here I would set out with the remark, that the
proof of the obligation of the Sabbath is to be sought for
entirely from the Scriptures.&nbsp; The whole rests upon a Divine
Revelation.&nbsp; And it becomes the more needful to examine what
is said upon the subject, in that Revelation, as an attempt has
frequently been made to prove that the Christian Sabbath,
especially, is not a Divine institution, and that the fact of its
sanctity rests only <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>upon the authority of the Church, and not upon that of
<span class="smcap">God</span> Himself.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; And, first, with respect to the original institution
of the Sabbath.&nbsp; It was one of the two great ordinances,
&ldquo;instituted of God in the time of man&rsquo;s
innocency;&rdquo; and it was consequently given at a very early
period in the history of the world.&nbsp; The record of the
command, and of the purposes for which it was designed, is found
in Gen. ii. 1&ndash;3.&nbsp; Several things are apparent from a
consideration of this passage.&nbsp; We see that the Sabbath was
given to the whole race of mankind, because it was given to our
first parents; that <span class="smcap">God</span> &ldquo;blessed
it,&rdquo; that is, designed it to be the source of especial
blessings to Adam and his descendants; and that He sanctified it,
that is, &ldquo;set it apart,&rdquo; which is the literal meaning
of the words, for sacred purposes.&nbsp; We find no reference
made to any particular people, but it was evidently designed as
an example from the Divine Creator to the whole human
family.&nbsp; The work of creation had occupied six days, and on
the seventh &ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> rested from all
His work which He created and made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the brief records of the ante-diluvian world, and in the
lives of the Patriarchs before Moses, which are given us by the
sacred historian, we find traces of a weekly division of time,
and intimations that every seventh day was observed as a time of
rest and religious worship.&nbsp; The sons of Adam are described
as each making an offering unto <span class="smcap">God</span>:
&ldquo;And in process of time it came to <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>pass, that Cain
brought of the fruit of the ground, an offering unto the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>; and Abel, he also brought of the
firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now
the words, &ldquo;process of time,&rdquo; literally mean
&ldquo;at the end of the days,&rdquo; that is, at the end of a
certain number of days,&mdash;a very natural expression for the
end of a week.&nbsp; And they seem to convey an intimation of the
original command to keep the Sabbath as a day of religious
worship.</p>
<p>The account of the gift of the manna, <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a> which took place in the second month of
the Exodus from Egypt, is a very remarkable proof that the
seventh day was kept holy, and regarded as a day of rest before
the giving of the Law.&nbsp; Every seventh day the Israelites
were commanded to gather twice as much manna as on ordinary days,
as none fell upon the seventh day; and, contrary to what usually
took place, the double quantity which they gathered was
miraculously preserved in a state fit for food.&nbsp; Now, in the
whole of this account, no precept is given for the observance of
the Sabbath day; but it proceeds upon the supposition that the
Israelites were well acquainted, both with the institution
itself, and with the purposes for which it had been originally
given.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; We now come to what is said upon the Sabbath in the
law of the Ten Commandments, which were given by <span
class="smcap">God</span> to Moses, and which are referred to in
Scripture as the sum of the moral precepts <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>of <span
class="smcap">God</span> to man.&nbsp; The obligation to keep
holy the Sabbath day is repeated in the fourth Commandment.&nbsp;
We shall find, from the writings of the New Testament, that our
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span> and His Apostles never allude
to the Ten Commandments but as of permanent and universal
obligation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think not,&rdquo; says <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, &ldquo;that I am come to destroy the
Law, or the Prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to
fulfil.&rdquo; <a name="citation8a"></a><a href="#footnote8a"
class="citation">[8a]</a>&nbsp; And not only is the perpetual
obligation of the Sabbath to be inferred from such general
expressions of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> but we have
His own direct authority for it, when He says, &ldquo;The Sabbath
was made <i>for man</i>,&rdquo; <a name="citation8b"></a><a
href="#footnote8b" class="citation">[8b]</a>&mdash;for the race,
and so is binding upon all to the end of time.</p>
<p>We might, if it were needful, refer you to the numerous
threatenings which are denounced against those who shall violate
the Sabbath, and to the blessings which are promised to those who
shall keep it holy, which are scattered through the prophetic
parts of Scripture, and to the latter of which the words of my
text belong; but enough has been said to show that the perpetual
obligation to observe a seventh day rests upon no less an
authority than that of a Divine command.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Christian Sabbath is the first day of the
week.&nbsp; Intimations of the reason of the change from the
seventh to the first day of the week are to be found in the fact
that the glories of Judaism had passed away with the advent of
the <span class="smcap">Messiah</span>, and were succeeded by a
new and better dispensation; <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>and it may have been deemed a fitting
honour to mark the commencement of this new dispensation, by the
consecration in the Church of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
of that day on which the mystery of human redemption was
accomplished.&nbsp; It was on the first day of the week that the
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span> rose again, and so was
&ldquo;declared to be the Son of <span class="smcap">God</span>
with power, by the resurrection from the dead.&rdquo; <a
name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a"
class="citation">[9a]</a>&nbsp; It was at the same time, a week
afterwards, that He appeared to the disciples when they were
assembled together, and confirmed by His presence the doubting
faith of St. Thomas.&nbsp; This day, too, was marked by the
descent of the Holy Ghost at the feast of Pentecost, when <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> was first preached by the Apostles to
the Gentile world.</p>
<p>We find from the New Testament and the earliest ecclesiastical
records, that the primitive Christians always observed this day
during the lifetime of the Apostles.&nbsp; They seem to have
assembled on the first day of the week to break bread, that is,
to celebrate the <span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> Supper,
and to receive religious instruction; and the custom had
doubtless become universal, as it was observed in Asia Minor. <a
name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a>&nbsp; St. John <a
name="citation9c"></a><a href="#footnote9c"
class="citation">[9c]</a> appears to have kept this day with
peculiar solemnity, and from him we learn that it had obtained a
particular designation in the Church&mdash;&ldquo;the <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> day,&rdquo; a name which it has
ever since retained.</p>
<p>In addition to this evidence, we may remark <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>that some of
the early Fathers refer to this day as the period set apart for
religious worship, and allude to the difference between keeping
the first day of the week and the seventh, especially on the
ground of its being the day of our Saviour&rsquo;s
resurrection.</p>
<p>Such, very briefly, are the general arguments for the
observance of the Sabbath, derived from the words of the original
institution; from the practice of the patriarchs before the
giving of the Law; from the express injunction contained in the
Ten Commandments, which, by the authority of our <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> and His Apostles, are binding upon
Christians; and from the practice of the primitive Church during
the lifetime of the Apostles, and in the ages which immediately
succeeded.</p>
<p>It is not needful that I should dwell upon them at greater
length; and we proceed now to examine in what manner the Sabbath
should be kept holy.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The words of the Prophet, to which I have called
your attention, are primarily addressed to the Jews, but it
involves no accommodation of Scripture to consider them as
applying to ourselves, since the obligation to keep holy the
Sabbath day rests equally upon us, as it did upon them.&nbsp;
They embrace many particulars of duty, and contain a promise, on
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> part, to bless with honour
and temporal prosperity those who shall reverence His day.</p>
<p>Now the observance of the Sabbath may be regarded both as a
National and as an Individual duty.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>And
first, to regard it as a National duty.&nbsp; The Bible lays it
down as a general principle, that every nation and kingdom owes
its existence and continuance as a nation, to the special power
and protection of the Most High.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the kingdom is
the <span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span>; and He is the
Governor among the nations.&rdquo; <a name="citation11a"></a><a
href="#footnote11a" class="citation">[11a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;By Me
kings reign, and princes decree justice.&nbsp; By Me princes
rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.&rdquo; <a
name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a>&nbsp; In nothing, indeed, is the hand
of <span class="smcap">God</span> more strikingly to be seen than
in the history of nations; and it will be found to be a truth to
which the annals of the past bear ample record, that national
prosperity has invariably followed that people who have honoured
Him.</p>
<p>We might take the case of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> ancient people, and find
abundant proof of this in the prosperity which everywhere
attended them.&nbsp; We might recall the scenes of &ldquo;the
land of bondage,&rdquo; the signs and wonders which were shown in
Egypt, the overthrow of Pharaoh and his mighty host beneath the
waves of the Red Sea.&nbsp; We might recount the victories of
Israel over the powerful and warlike nations of Canaan, nations
&ldquo;greater and mightier than&rdquo; themselves, whom <span
class="smcap">God</span> drove out from before their face.&nbsp;
We might speak of the fast-increasing glories of that people in
the earlier years of their political existence, and of the
fearful and rapid decline which followed their idolatrous
practices and forsaking of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>But do we not find, even in the midst of ourselves, <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>an evidence
more powerful and convincing still?&nbsp; To what is it that
England owes her supremacy?&nbsp; Why is it that success has
attended her arms almost without a single exception? that the
Queen of these small and insignificant islands is the Sovereign
Lady of nearly a sixth part of the human race? that the sway of
Great Britain is undisputed upon the sea, and her arms respected
by every foreign nation?&nbsp; How is it that while revolution
after revolution has disturbed the tranquillity of neighbouring
nations, while kings have been hurried into exile or to death,
and scenes of carnage and bloodshed been of terrible frequency,
we have been suffered to remain in peace and quietness, our
friendly relations with Foreign Powers been maintained
unimpaired, and our commercial prosperity never, perhaps, known
to be greater?&nbsp; I think the true answer will be found in the
fact, that as a nation we have &ldquo;acknowledged <span
class="smcap">God</span> in all our ways,&rdquo; and that so
&ldquo;He has directed our paths.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing is more
striking to any person who has visited the neighbouring countries
of Europe than the difference with which the <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> day is observed in them, and
amongst ourselves.&nbsp; And after all, it is mainly in this
respect that a <i>national</i> acknowledgment of <span
class="smcap">God</span> can be made.&nbsp; Take, for example,
the metropolis of the neighbouring empire of France, the city of
Paris.&nbsp; It is a well ascertained fact that, in that city,
there is a far greater amount of dissipation and wickedness on
the Sunday, than on any other day in the <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>week.&nbsp;
It would seem that <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> day is
especially selected to be dishonoured.&nbsp; Every place of
public amusement is open,&mdash;galleries of
painting&mdash;public gardens&mdash;theatres.&nbsp; Reviews of
troops, displays, and pageants of every kind commonly take place
upon this day.&nbsp; It is quite true that the people attend the
services of the Romish Church, and that religion is treated with
some degree of decorum and respect.&nbsp; But what is the result
of such a system?&nbsp; Simply, that the service of <span
class="smcap">God</span> comes to be looked upon as something
which may be satisfactorily performed by a mere attendance at
Mass, and by obedience to such outward duties as the Church may
enjoin, and that then every kind of sinful pleasure and amusement
may be indulged in with impunity.&nbsp; Can we wonder at the
consequences which follow from such a state of things?&nbsp; Can
we be surprised at a corruption of manners which prevails to an
alarming extent amongst all classes of society?&nbsp; Can we
marvel that, time after time, the foundations of that kingdom are
shaken&mdash;that, in its many changes and revolutions, the
handwriting of <span class="smcap">God</span> is seen, which says
with fearful significance, &ldquo;Thou art weighed in the
balances, and art found wanting?&rdquo; <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a></p>
<p>Now England has hitherto been remarkable for her outward
observance of the <span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span>
day.&nbsp; The entire cessation from business&mdash;the quiet
streets&mdash;the orderly inhabitants&mdash;the well-filled
churches, in our large towns&mdash;the village bells breaking the
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>stillness
of the Sabbath morning, and in every place calling the rich and
poor alike to the House of their common <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>&mdash;have marked us out,
pre-eminently, as a nation fearing <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; And it must be a source of deep
regret and alarm to every Christian man, and, indeed, to every
man who values aright the national peace and prosperity which the
blessing of <span class="smcap">God</span> has secured to this
kingdom, that an attempt is being made, and that too of a most
determined character, to infringe the sanctity of the Sabbath,
and to obtain the repeal of the law which enforces its strict
observance.</p>
<p>Far be it from me to wish that the Sabbath should be made a
day of painful and irksome restraint; that the hardworked artisan
should be denied the enjoyment of such innocent recreation as the
day will allow; that the times should be revived in this country,
when every man should be compelled to attend his Parish Church on
pain of fine or imprisonment; but I would use every means in my
power to maintain those wise and righteous regulations which a
Christian government has made respecting its observance.&nbsp; I
believe it to be the duty of the clergy of the Church of England
to speak openly and plainly upon the subject, and to use all the
influence of their station and office to prevent the commission
of this great national sin.&nbsp; And I trust I may be excused in
entering into details, which will not, I hope, be deemed
inappropriate to the time and occasion on which we are met
together.&nbsp; I will state them very briefly.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>You are
aware that the building of the Great Exhibition, which was held
in London, in the summer of 1851, has been removed to a distance
from the city, and converted into a kind of winter garden and
museum.&nbsp; Many of you have seen the building, which is
capable of containing nearly a hundred thousand persons; and it
is proposed to admit the public to it on Sundays by the payment
of money.&nbsp; This is at present illegal by Act of Parliament,
no places of public amusement, the admission to which is by
money, being allowed to remain open on that day.&nbsp; A petition
will shortly be presented to Parliament, praying for the repeal
of that Act.&nbsp; A gentleman of considerable eminence and
ability, who is officially connected with this movement, is about
to visit the large towns of England, for the purpose of
advocating the subject, and obtaining signatures in favour of
it&mdash;chiefly from the working classes; and he will very
probably visit this town.</p>
<p>Now I would say to you all, as you fear the curse of <span
class="smcap">God</span> upon this nation, as you would secure
the continuance of His favour and blessing, and of that peace
which England has so long enjoyed, abstain from signing that
petition; abstain from attending public meetings upon the
subject; use all your influence to prevent others from doing
so.</p>
<p>I am quite sure that this proceeding will meet with no
countenance or sanction from the Civic Authorities of this
town.&nbsp; We are blessed with rulers, who, as I believe, have
made &ldquo;the fear of <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>&rdquo; the great principle which
actuates them in their public conduct, and which will lead them
to use the authority and influence which, in His providence, He
has committed to them, for the maintenance of His honour and
glory.</p>
<p>I need not remind you what will surely follow this step,
unless, by <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> gracious
interposition, it be averted.&nbsp; The opening of the theatres
and of all places of public amusement on the Sunday will take
place, and everything which now distinguishes <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> day from the days of our worldly
business be at an end.&nbsp; This must be the inevitable
consequence of once opening the door to the desecration of the
Sabbath.&nbsp; How then shall the Church of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> be able effectually to stem the
torrent of vice which will sweep over this land?&nbsp; How check
the march of infidelity, which is sure to advance with giant
strides amongst us?&nbsp; We know that even now, in spite of all
our efforts, <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Sabbaths are
fearfully profaned.&nbsp; Though our churches are multiplied on
every hand, and those schools in which our children are trained
for the Church on earth, and, as we trust, for the Church
eternally, in Heaven, are increased, yet much remains to be
accomplished ere the &ldquo;way&rdquo; of the &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Lord</span> be known upon earth, His saving health
among all nations.&rdquo; <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a>&nbsp; The mountains
of unbelief have yet to be laid low, the valleys of ignorance and
vice to be exalted, before <span class="smcap">Messiah</span>, in
His onward and triumphant march, can receive the homage of those
hearts <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>which He has purchased with His own most precious blood,
ere He can enter upon the glories of that universal kingdom in
which &ldquo;all shall know Him from the least to the
greatest.&rdquo; <a name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a"
class="citation">[17a]</a></p>
<p>Let it then be ours to use every effort to &ldquo;prepare the
way of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,&rdquo; that so we may
be the blessed instruments of advancing the <span
class="smcap">Redeemer&rsquo;s</span> kingdom upon earth.&nbsp;
Amongst us, let His name and His Sabbaths be honoured and
reverenced; and, above all, let us unite in earnest prayer to Him
who can &ldquo;destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to
nothing the understanding of the prudent,&rdquo; <a
name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b"
class="citation">[17b]</a> that He may frustrate the designs of
those who would array themselves against Him, that they may be
put to shame and confusion, and so His promise be fulfilled,
&ldquo;When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall lift up a standard
against him.&rdquo; <a name="citation17c"></a><a
href="#footnote17c" class="citation">[17c]</a></p>
<p>But while the observance of the Sabbath may be regarded as a
national duty, yet it is, at the same time, an individual
duty.&nbsp; While we are required, as a nation, to honour <span
class="smcap">God</span> in this respect, we have, besides, an
individual responsibility which is independent of it.</p>
<p>The subject opens to us a very wide field, and it would be
impossible, within the brief limits to which we are confined, to
enter upon all that might be said.&nbsp; The words of Isaiah
contain, perhaps, the fullest explanation of the manner in which
the Sabbath should be observed that is to be found in <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the records
of inspiration.&nbsp; They enjoin an entire cessation from our
worldly business and pleasures, and from all such conversation as
shall unfit us for the duties of religion; and, at the same time,
they teach us that our thoughts and attention should be directed
to the great business for which the day was instituted.</p>
<p>Now our duty upon the Sabbath naturally divides itself into
three parts: the public worship of <span
class="smcap">God</span>; the cultivation of family religion; and
the maintenance of personal piety.</p>
<p>It is not needful that I should seek, by anything which I
might say, to impress upon you the importance of a constant and
devout attendance upon the services of the Church.&nbsp; I need
not remind you of the blessings which shall surely be the portion
of those who shall &ldquo;dwell in the courts of the <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> house,&rdquo; and whose feet
are to be found in &ldquo;the sanctuary of <span
class="smcap">God</span>,&rdquo;&mdash;who are ever mindful of
the Saviour&rsquo;s promise, &ldquo;Where two or three are
gathered together in My Name, there am I in the midst of
them.&rdquo; <a name="citation18a"></a><a href="#footnote18a"
class="citation">[18a]</a>&nbsp; In many a heart does the
language of the sweet singer of Israel find an echo, when he
gives utterance to those exulting words, &ldquo;I was glad when
they said unto me, Let us go into the House of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.&nbsp; Our feet shall stand within thy
gates, Oh Jerusalem.&rdquo; <a name="citation18b"></a><a
href="#footnote18b" class="citation">[18b]</a>&nbsp; I speak to
those who love and reverence the Church of England&mdash;the
Church of our country and our fathers&mdash;the Church beneath
whose hallowed walls are <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>strewn the graves of Martyrs and
Confessors&mdash;the Church which has been watered by the blood
of the Saints, and which is surely &ldquo;built upon the
foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, <span
class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> Himself being the chief
corner-stone.&rdquo; <a name="citation19a"></a><a
href="#footnote19a" class="citation">[19a]</a>&nbsp; Oh that that
Church, whose &ldquo;walls are Salvation, and her gates
Praise,&rdquo; <a name="citation19b"></a><a href="#footnote19b"
class="citation">[19b]</a> may increase a hundredfold, and
flourish in the midst of us!&nbsp; Oh that she may be enshrined
in the hearts of the people of this land; that her divisions may
be healed, her time-honoured system be developed, and above all,
her &ldquo;priests be clothed with righteousness,&rdquo; <a
name="citation19c"></a><a href="#footnote19c"
class="citation">[19c]</a> that so her mission upon earth may be
accomplished in the subjugation of the hearts and affections of
men to the sway of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, and in the
building up, &ldquo;on their most holy faith,&rdquo; of &ldquo;a
people prepared for the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray for the peace
of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.&nbsp; Peace be
within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces!&rdquo; <a
name="citation19d"></a><a href="#footnote19d"
class="citation">[19d]</a></p>
<p>But the worship of <span class="smcap">God</span> is only one
of the duties of the Sabbath.&nbsp; The cultivation of family
religion is a work which should occupy at least some portion of
time on this day.&nbsp; The Sabbath was designed to be a day of
rest and holy joy.&nbsp; And surely these ends will be answered
if, in every little household, parents and children shall meet
together in happy and unrestrained intercourse; if it be a time
when children shall listen, from a mother&rsquo;s lips, to the
histories of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Saints, and
hear from her of the love of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>;
when parents <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>shall use all their efforts, that those who have
gathered beneath the same earthly roof, and sat around the same
fireside, may not be separated in the Eternal Home above.&nbsp;
Are we to be interested in each others&rsquo; worldly pleasures
and pursuits, to share each others&rsquo; earthly joys and
sorrows, and yet to have sealed hearts and sealed lips, where
&ldquo;those things which belong to our everlasting peace&rdquo;
are concerned?&nbsp; I believe that, under <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> blessing, there is no more
powerful instrument for good, than the early religious
instruction of home.&nbsp; The instruction of Sunday Schools is
good, and is a mighty instrument in the hands of the Church, for
advancing the cause of the <span class="smcap">Redeemer</span>,
but to be really effectual it must be combined with the education
of home.&nbsp; Who shall calculate its influence?&nbsp; Who shall
say how many a wayward one a mother&rsquo;s affectionate counsels
and admonitions, conveyed in the lesson of the Sunday evening,
have been the means of recalling from the paths of sin?&nbsp; Who
can tell how long those golden memories lingered in the heart,
ere their voice was stilled by long-continued disobedience to
<span class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; Nothing, perhaps, is so
deeply to be lamented in after life, as the want of the early
religious instruction of home.&nbsp; It entwines the things of
Heaven with the best and purest of earthly affections.&nbsp; It
associates them with the innocence of childhood, and the
happiness of home.&nbsp; It stamps upon the heart an impression,
which no subsequent career of sin can ever efface, that religion
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>is a happy
thing.&nbsp; It makes the Sabbath to be, what it was ever
designed to be, &ldquo;a delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the maintenance of personal piety is another of the ends
for which the Sabbath was instituted.&nbsp; We are placed upon
earth that we may prepare for eternity, and these pauses in our
lives, these intervals of rest, are intended by <span
class="smcap">God</span> as a means of bringing eternal things
from time to time more forcibly before us.&nbsp; Hence a more
than ordinary portion of our time should then be devoted to
private prayer, to meditation, to the reading of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Word.&nbsp; We should be
striving so to employ these blessed opportunities that they may
not at last become swift witnesses against us.&nbsp; We should
seek to place ourselves before &ldquo;the great white
throne,&rdquo; and to dwell in thought on &ldquo;Him who sitteth
on it.&rdquo;&nbsp; So will the tumults of passion be stilled in
our inmost hearts, and a more than earthly peace be breathed upon
our spirits.&nbsp; We shall learn more clearly the great truth,
which outward objects are ever hiding from our view, that
&ldquo;the world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but that he
that doeth the will of <span class="smcap">God</span> abideth for
ever.&rdquo; <a name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a"
class="citation">[21a]</a></p>
<p>The Sabbath is an emblem of Heaven, and a type of its joys,
and so it is in it that we must acquire a taste for those
enjoyments.&nbsp; The unregenerate man is unfit for Heaven.&nbsp;
It would be no Paradise to him.&nbsp; It is only &ldquo;the pure
in heart&rdquo; who &ldquo;shall see <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo; <a name="citation21b"></a><a
href="#footnote21b" class="citation">[21b]</a>&nbsp; Hence the
Christian is here meetening for its happiness.&nbsp; From time to
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>time the
veil is lifted, and he is permitted to behold faint glimpses of
its glories.&nbsp; In the service of an earthly sanctuary, he
hears an echo of the music of Heaven.&nbsp; In his seasons of
prayer and Communion with <span class="smcap">God</span>, and in
his freedom from earthly care and toil, he learns something of
that &ldquo;rest&rdquo; which &ldquo;remaineth for the people of
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation22a"></a><a href="#footnote22a"
class="citation">[22a]</a>&nbsp; The earthly Sabbath is but an
earnest and foretaste of the heavenly one.&nbsp; Here it is
succeeded by the struggles and anxieties of life.&nbsp; Here
thoughts of worldly care often interrupt its happiness.&nbsp;
Here there is but the offering of an earthly service, and the
devotion of an earthly heart.&nbsp; But there all shall be
changed.&nbsp; For His Saints &ldquo;shall serve Him day and
night in His temple: they shall hunger no more, neither thirst
any more, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any
heat.&rdquo; <a name="citation22b"></a><a href="#footnote22b"
class="citation">[22b]</a>&nbsp; No &ldquo;tears&rdquo; shall dim
the eye.&nbsp; No &ldquo;death&rdquo; shall enter the home, and
take away from us those whom we love.&nbsp; No &ldquo;sorrow nor
crying,&rdquo; no &ldquo;pain&rdquo; shall be there, &ldquo;for
the former things will have passed away.&rdquo; <a
name="citation22c"></a><a href="#footnote22c"
class="citation">[22c]</a></p>
<p>Be it then your part and mine, brethren, to seek, through
&ldquo;the blood of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>,&rdquo; a
meetness for this heavenly rest; so to employ the days of
preparation for it which <span class="smcap">God</span> has given
us, that we may indeed &ldquo;call the Sabbath a delight, the
holy of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, honourable:&rdquo;
to maintain by seasons of worship and earnest service, by
Communion with Him at His Table, and in the retirement of the <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>closet, a
living union with <span class="smcap">Christ</span> our Head,
that so when our earthly Sabbaths shall have come to a close, and
the opportunities of usefulness upon earth be past, we may enter
upon that perfect worship and service, which shall develop every
power and satisfy every desire of an immortal nature, and share
in the rest of that Sabbath which shall never have an end!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
